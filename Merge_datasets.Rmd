This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 


The purpose of this analysis is to determine the correlation between various variables and avoidable death rates.
The data was gathered from stat.oecd and data worldbank websites.

It should be noted that our data spans a period of 20 years: from 2000 up to 2019.
Therefore, our dataset includes samples from the same country but different years.
Of course, no all countries have been gathering data since 2000. As a result, some countries might be overrepresented in our data, since they have been gathering data for a longer time. Nevertheless, I chose to include all of the data since filtering for a specific year or a specific country would result in a very small number of samples.

This notebook joins all of the data.
The analysis is performed on a different notebook.
